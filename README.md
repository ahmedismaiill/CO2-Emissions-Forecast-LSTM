## 📌 Project Overview
The rapid accumulation of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is a primary driver of global climate change. Understanding historical emission patterns and accurately forecasting future trends is crucial for environmental policymaking.

This project implements a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network to predict daily CO2 emissions across **14 countries** and **6 economic sectors**. By transforming raw transactional data into a multivariate time-series, the model captures complex non-linear dependencies, seasonality, and the impact of global events (such as the COVID-19 pandemic).

The project further integrates **MLOps** practices using **MLflow** for experiment tracking and features a user-friendly **Streamlit Dashboard** for real-time forecasting.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset recording daily CO2 emissions in **MtCO₂/day** (Million Tonnes of Carbon Dioxide per day).

*   **Scope:** 14 Countries (including Brazil, China, US, India, Germany, etc.)
*   **Sectors:** Power, Industry, Ground Transport, Residential, Domestic Aviation, International Aviation.
*   **Original Size:** 135,408 records (Long Format).
*   **Processed Size:** 22,568 records (Wide Format, Pivot Table).

**Data Transformation:**
The data was pivoted from a "long" format (one row per sector) to a "wide" format. This allows the LSTM model to learn the correlations between all 6 sectors simultaneously for a specific country and date.

## 🛠 Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
*   **Datetime Conversion:** Standardizing dates and sorting chronologically.
*   **Pivoting:** Reshaping data so columns represent sectors (`Domestic Aviation`, `Power`, etc.).
*   **Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Country Encoding:** Using `LabelEncoder` to transform country names into numerical features.
    *   **Scaling:** Applying `MinMaxScaler` to normalize features and targets between 0 and 1.
    *   **Sliding Window:** Creating a time-series window of **12 days** (Time Steps) to predict the next day's emissions.

### 2. LSTM Model Architecture
We constructed a Deep Learning model using **TensorFlow/Keras**:
*   **Input Layer:** `(12, 7)` shape (12 days history, 6 sectors + 1 country code).
*   **LSTM Layers:** Two LSTM layers (128 units and 64 units) to capture temporal dependencies.
*   **Regularization:** Dropout layers (20%) to prevent overfitting.
*   **Output Layer:** A Dense layer with 6 units (one for each sector) using ReLU activation.

### 3. MLOps & Deployment
*   **MLflow:** Used to log experiments, save the model with an inferred signature, and track metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²).
*   **Streamlit:** A Python-based web app that loads the trained `.keras` model and scalers to provide an interface for non-technical users.

## 📈 Results
The model was evaluated on a held-out test set (last 15% of the timeline), achieving exceptional accuracy.

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **R² Score** | **0.9889** | The model explains ~99% of the variance in the data. |
| **MSE** | 0.3954 | Low squared error indicating a tight fit. |
| **MAE** | 0.2318 | Minimal average absolute deviation per prediction. |

**Key Visual Insights:**
*   **Seasonality:** Accurately captured winter heating spikes in the *Residential* sector.
*   **Impact of Events:** Modeled the sharp decline and recovery in *Ground Transport* during the 2020 pandemic.
